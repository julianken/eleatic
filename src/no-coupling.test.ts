/**
 * Zero-coupling guard: eleatic carries NO `@bird-watch/*` import and no
 * `../../`-escaping relative import anywhere under {src,ui}, and its
 * package.json declares NO `@bird-watch/*` dependency. This boundary is what let
 * the package extract cleanly out of its original monorepo into this standalone
 * repo, and it keeps the package self-contained going forward (any consumer
 * depends on eleatic, never the reverse).
 *
 * It asserts both source-level imports (scanned under {src,ui}) and the
 * package.json dependency surface (manifest coupling). The recursive scan uses
 * `readdirSync` (the `recursive` option needs Node >= 18.17/20 — satisfied by
 * `engines.node` >= 20). The tsconfig is self-contained — the former
 * `extends "../../tsconfig.base.json"` was inlined at extraction — so there is
 * no remaining cross-package file-system coupling.

/**
 * Domain-agnosticism guard for the trace renderers (T7 / epic #1193 §8).
 *
 * eleatic renders a GENERIC span tree from an opaque `trace` blob. A span's
 * `name` ('judge', a scorer name, …) flowing through trace_json is DATA — fine
 * and expected. The coupling risk is a RENDERER hardcoding that vocabulary,
 * e.g. `if (span.name === 'judge')` or an `iconByKind` that keys off a scorer
 * name. A quoted-string scan of the trace UI source catches exactly that: a
 * hardcoded photo-judge literal lands in source as a quoted token, while the
 * same word arriving as runtime data does not.
 *
 * Why a QUOTED-string scan and why 'eval'/'task' are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED:
 * 'eval' and 'task' collide with the package's own identifiers and prose —
 * EvalSpan/EvalRowRecord/evalGate, the synthesized legacy-root `kind: 'eval'`
 * (trace-tree.js), and "eleatic invents no eval domain" comments (trace.js:3,
 * trace-view.js). A `\beval\b`/`\btask\b` scan would false-positive and fail
 * this guard the moment it landed. The quoted scorer/judge terms below are
 * high-signal and collision-free against the package's own vocabulary.
 *
 * If this block ever fails: DO NOT weaken the regex to make it pass. A match
 * means a renderer hardcoded a photo-judge literal — a real coupling bug to
 * fix (rename to a generic token, or read the value as data), not to silence.
